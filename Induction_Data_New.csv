"They claim extended cooling technology - but forgot to install an automatic cut-off.Essentially, the device comes with a built-in fan for cooling. I already have PIC 12 model in which, after the heating is done, the fan runs for about a minute or so and automatically switches off.But in PIC 20, it never switches off. They claim it is ""extended cooling technology"" and we need to wait another 5 to 10 minutes before switching off the device. Are they expecting us to use another TIMER to wait for 5 minutes?This is electronic-age, a simple timer they could have incorporated, if needed with a thermostat so as to turn off the fan at the right time.In short, I returned the item.",24 August 2020

This is my first induction cooktop. But it was very easy to use. With the preset cooking buttons the job was very easy for a amateur like me. 1200w is powerful enough for boiling 1 ltr water in 2-3 minutes. Consumes 5A at max power so it can be easy used on domestic 5A socket.,18 August 2020
Not that good...Takes too much time for everything.,18 August 2020
"This is the 2nd time I‚Äôm purchasing the same model from prestige, which conked off.1st unit worked for more 1year then conked off.(warranty expired)2nd unit purchased in July month and it conked off within a month( under warranty). When you switch on, power trips in the whole house. Initially thought my power plugpoint may be a problem, but it wasn‚Äôt. I went to switch on using different plug points in the house, power trips every time we switch on.My question is on the quality of product, why is this unit failing so frequently. I even checked my wiring in house to see if power source has problem. But I found all power sources in house are all fine.Pls do publish my feedback to manufacturer so that they work on reliability & quality of products",18 August 2020

Because of this reason, whenever I start to heat something, I always received E6 (over heated) within  a minute or two.

Best Product,20 July 2020
"The product is excellent. Initially, I was in two minds reading some negative comments, but I took a chance as Prestige is a reputed brand. On opening the product, I found it exactly as per the expectations. The heater was nicely packed and delivered on schedule. There were no issues with the packing / wiring of insulation or internal parts, as claimed by some buyers. Those may be isolated cases. The product has many push buttons customised for indian items, like pressure cooker, milk boiling, keeping food warm, deep frying etc. The heater has adjustable temperature/ power for customised heating. The product is light weight and has reasonably good workmanship. For those, who are in two minds, please go for this product. There may be other better products (which I have not tried), but definitely this product is worth the price.One more thing I would like to add here is that we need flat bottom SS utensils for heating on this induction heater. So if you do not already have them, please do order induction-compatible utensils/cookers.",20 July 2020

One of their engineer come and say it PCB is damage we had to repair it. When I asked him to replace the piece or PCB he only said no we can only repair it till guarantee period.What the hell!

Also the Ceramic surface is being broken after using it for long usage while making chappatis.I really do not recommend this if you want to make rotis or frying something.,28 April 2020

"Product is faulty and prone to short circuit! It‚Äôs just 1 month of usage for me and if water touches the control panel or under it, then it will malfunction. It will be literally impossible to save the machine from water as during cooking it will get messy. The machine no longer works.One solution is lifting machine height by 1Cm so that water doesn‚Äôt go inside and gives the fan more space to operate.Handle with extreme care, with no water spillages from your vessels.",22 April 2020

"The PRESTIGE PIC20 INDUCTION COOKTOP has glassy finish ceramic plate. All Indian dish menu option is available in this cooktop. There is no damage while delivery. The package is fully protected with strong cartoon. I bought it in RS1400 which is very profitable with this honoured company. It is better than pigeon induction cooktop. It is  also power saving by automatic voltage regulator, cut off  after no longer use and consumers only 1200 watt of energy.I advise you all who see my review and think to buy, then I preferred to you all to buy only this prestige PIC 20 induction cooktop.

When I return to my room again it's started it's same activity. Now the induction is not producing heat. Most important as I crossed across 10 days return period now I can't return it to Amazon. I was supposed to by from flipcart. But in Amazon the same product I got 200 of  so I took from Amazon... Now m getting why they put 200 off.... Just falto... Amazon...

"The basic functionality is OK but overall the system needs some improvements.1) When switched ON the device starts with maximum wattage consumption, which is simply not advisable for any electrical device. The systems should always start with minimum wattage and then the user can increase the temperature to the desired levels, as per the cooking specs2) The various buttons assigned with the various cooking options must also specify the temperature range beside the buttons.3) The digital display panel is so soft and vulnerable even to a sharp object like human nails. The panel needs a sturdy protection either with glass or some sort of hard transparent plastic.",6 November 2019

"The induction stove was lying with me for almost 3 years unused as we did not have any induction cookwares and never bothered to buy one either. But then I got a gift from someone and thought of experimenting.  Only then I realised that how useful and effective it is. The cooking temperatures are perfect, seldom you can get something burnt and most important you can cook comfortably under a fan or even an AC. Wow! I fried 50 pcs of perfect chicken pakoras sitting comfortably in AC, chatting with my friends and  having a drink or two. Another very important aspect is nothing will catch fire while cooking you can even place your glass of whiskey right beside the oven ;)",29 September 2019

"Have been using this item since many years, induction cooktop from Prestige is most reliable, however always prefer a basic model against higher model with additional feature , simple the model, more the same is reliable. Bought this after as earlier cooktop same model stopped functioning (almost 4 years). After guarantee period, going for repairs is waste of time as such items are not easy to repair, hence suggest to go for basic model. Also induction cook top should be used as stand by option instead of main option for cooking, extensive use will damage the product.",25 August 2019

"First of all, I'd like to say that induction cooker is more convenient, safer and less expensive than gas. Before I had the cooker with gas to eat hot pot, and they are out of gas during hot pot and we must change new one, the result is inexhaustible, throwing half gas is so waste. This annoyance has gone away since I bought this one. I‚Äôve been using it for a week now ! And this induction cooktop works great so far . It heats up fast and offers more control , it has more energy efficient than gas or electric. In addition to hot pot, but also can cook foodÔºåboiling water, in short, this induction cooker is both economical and easy to use„ÄÇthis induction cooker is good choice„ÄÇ",8 August 2019

The material used is not of good quality. The older Prestige induction is heavy duty, this one is light and doesn't have a good grip so it moves around and feels cheap. Other than that does it's work well.

"The cook top is so fragile, it got broken before the delivery. I am highly disappointed with amazon. Amazon is focing only to its prime customers and not to regular customer.talking about the broken product, it seems ot cant bear weight more than 5 kg, the body is plastic not very thick or durable and will start cracking soon after regular use. The only thing that motivated me to buy the product was the company name, but I think Prestige is also no more a brand you can trust for durability of products.I was disappointed with the price aswell. Wattage is very low as compared to other brands at same price of 1730 Rs.Overall a very very disappointing experience, both by Prestige and Amazon. Would give zero star If I could.",27 April 2019

Would survive with little care.Finish is good.Quality of wire and power connector is good.Has built in presets for common Indian cooking like Dosa/chapati, pressure Cook, curry, idly and deep fry. Otherwise we set power levels and timer as per needs.It does not have some of the advance features line pressure cooker whisle counter (some higher end prestige inductions have feature to auto turn off after specific number of cooler whistles).Working OK for me for more than a year of occasional use. Good for the price of around Rs 1700 or less when on sale here on Amazon.Adding few pictures and a video.",24 January 2019

Super,11 July 2018
This is a pretty powerful easy to use induction cook top from prestige. But we need to know that the max power output from this is 1200W so the cooking will be pretty slow. Boiling water takes some time too. I will recommend users to buy a higher power stove because it aids faster cooking. Also the button are not touch so it will make it harder to press than to touch.The cooking area is good enough for most of the utensil sizes. But length of the wire could have been little longer. I am not sure why Amazon gives this as recommended when there are others with better features. Also I felt the stove may not last 3-4 years. It may at the maximum hold its state for 1 year or so. I may not be able to update my review then. But surely the content does not look very great.It does heat up the plastic and ceramic used so please be little careful while using it. One most important thing is that we can use most of the STAIN LESS STEEL utensil we have in our house as this cook top supports it.Please click on helpful if you find it helpful.Thanks for reading,11 July 2018

Prestige is a highly reputed brand in India as far as cookware is concerned. So, buying their induction cook top is a good idea. I tried all sorts of cooking.

nice product but heating is very slowly.  service is very good from Amazon's.,26 September 2017
"Great product, been using it for over a mth now. We still have no LPG gas connection so been using this hot plate. Food definitely cooks faster than the conventional gas stove but you gotta be careful when you boiling milk as it easily spills over or you could end up burning most of your food. It's got different options and they all work very well. The dosa/chapatti option is good but I used it only for dosas. For chapattis, I just used the deep fry option which is set all 20 to make quick chapattis. After a couple of cooking time, you will easily get a hang of the product",26 September 2017

This Induction cooktop is very expensive in markets and its cookware or pot is also expensive as well.(2). You can't use all types of pot for cooking, only induction based pot will helpful in cooking.(3). During cooking, a lot of problems  may you face during temperature manage.(4). Definitely cooking will faster but quality of food will remain raw and not up to the level.but durability is good.It is so easy to handle during cooking and any one can handle this even child also.Style and Design is good.I cant talk about Service and support because my induction is working properly and I don't need service and support till date.So I want to suggest that if u are expert in temperature handling  during cooking then please go for it otherwise it is not for you.",14 July 2017

This induction cooker is simple to use and hots the container quite quickly and cooks efficiantly. It is electric saving than higher wattage induction cookers. It clearly identifies non-induction cookware with E0 error display. The radius of the cooktop heating-area is little small which is a drawback to use medium to big-base utensils.,7 June 2017

"Useful only in emergency but not for daily cooking. It doesn't do what I want it to. Deep frying was a nightmare as the oil was oozing out of the pan and when i tried to make curry, it didn't cook it to perfection. The flavour is lost...when I want to boil a soup, it just evaporates the liquid rather than infusing the flavour. If you can see what I mean.

"It is ideal for a family of two and is very muich ok for 1.4 k.It is not as sturdy as the Bajaj brand I used for last five years. Although claimed to be feather touch, the buttons are not that soft to operate.  The presets are there but the most frequent requirement of mine is to boil water, either for drinking or for making tea. There is no suitable preset for this. Of course, you can use pressure cook mode which is the default one and decrease temp and set time. Time setting can be done up to one minute, which is good. The length of the power cord is slightly longer than one mtr. Wish it were longer.The packing wasn't very safe.Although the factory cover was opened (itself a turn-off, as far as choosing a dealer is concerned, the warranty card has no dealer stamp or date stamp.",7 May 2017

Appropriate cooking induction stove for max 2person. Deep Fry mode power plan varies from 70 to 220 watt which should be mostly used for cooking . Don't run the stove at 1100watt  in any mode.Pigeon3 letter Pressure cooker works perfectly at 500watt. Operating at 700 or 1100 watt is not prescribed for the cooker hence reduce the power while using pressure cooker mode to save electricity and vessels.Cookware(2+leter kadai  with glass lid and 1pan)  of decent price around 849 is available from the rival company site and avoid buying Amazon recommended induction cook ware of 800rs which is inferior product and lack induction base.If you cook/fry/pressure cook food for 1hr every day then appropriate monthly electric bill will be around 15unit(45 to 70 rs),18 April 2017

"What was that ? I bought it looking at it's 4 star rating but what the hell . It's fan making so much noise like stones grinding. Not only this , every 1 minute it's shows E6 error - sign of over heating. I am so disappointed.  Are these 4 ratings fake or what ? Not only this I got suspicious of the product because of it's packing. Box was old and openings were stitched  with cello tape . It seemed they gave me one of the returned product - which after 1 day of use I am returning again. Though date of manufacture was Oct 2016. I am pretty sure they will repack and hand this useless defective product to next customer who order online.  This is the code of product - L10161190650. If you get it , remember , it was already returned by me as it was defective.",23 December 2016

"Well Well Well. . .The is good enough and serves the most need required.Just a thing what i felt is that its minimum temperature i.e. 100 ¬∞C is also fast enough. . . Because if we have kept a milk or tea pan on it at 100¬∞C, then also after sometime we need to take care of its overflow.This thing I didn't noticed on any other previous Induction i ever used.Rest every thing is good enough.Thanks to Amazon.",1 December 2016

"The product looks better than it looks in the pictures. Not a photogenic piece of appliance I guess. Jokes aside, it delivers as advertised. The only slight problem I encountered is the control panel. It's coated with a plastic film or laminate which tends to show air bubbles underneath it, though the functionality is not affected. Get it registered on prestige site to avail the warranty.",30 November 2016
